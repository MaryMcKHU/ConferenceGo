# ConferenceGO
This is a full-stack web application that assists with conference event-planning. It started out as a monolith and was refactored into multiple microservices with the use of RabbitMQ and pub/sub. The UI allows users to input new locations, input new conference details, input information to attend a conference, and input information to make a presentation proposal. The use can see information about previously inputted conferences on the main page. See "Design" section for screenshots of each part of the UI.
